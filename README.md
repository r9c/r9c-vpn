# r9c-vpn
An experimental, lightweight VPN tunnel built in Python (WIP).

## Overview:
Custom VPN designed from scratch utilizing Python sockets. It creates an encrypted tunnel between a client and server, basically replicating the basic behavior of a traditional VPN.
Currently, this project is a work in progress and mainly focuses on building core VPN functionality while learning low level network concepts and secure communication.

## Features (So Far)
- Encrypted client-server connection
- Basic socket communication over TCP
- Manual server and client startup
- Easy to extend and test

## In Progress
- Authentication layer
- Configurable encryption (e.g., AES)
- GUI frontend (Tkinter or Electron)
- Server selection / multiple node management
- Kill switch + DNS leak protection
